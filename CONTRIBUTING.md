## Development Setup

### 1. Clone your fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chethanyadav456/WinFlux.git
cd WinFlux
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

### 4. Create a feature branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
```

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow **PEP 8** style guide
- Use **type hints** where appropriate
- Write **docstrings** for all functions and classes
- Keep functions **small and focused**
- Use **meaningful variable names**

### Example:

```python
def clean_temp_files(self) -> None:
    """
    Clean temporary files from system temp directories.
    
    This method scans and removes files from:
    - %TEMP%
    - Windows\Temp
    - Prefetch folder
    
    Raises:
        PermissionError: If admin privileges are required
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Update EXAMPLES.md with usage examples
- Add docstrings to new functions/classes
- Comment complex logic

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test
python -m pytest tests/test_cleanup.py
```

### Adding New Features

When adding a new feature:

1. **Create a new module** in `winflux/modules/` if needed
2. **Add CLI command** in `winflux/cli.py`
3. **Write tests** in `tests/`
4. **Update documentation**
5. **Add example output** to EXAMPLES.md

### Example: Adding a new module

```python
# winflux/modules/new_feature.py
"""
New Feature Module - Description
"""

from rich.console import Console

console = Console()


class NewFeatureModule:
    """Handle new feature operations."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def do_something(self):
        """Do something useful."""
        console.print("[cyan]Doing something...[/cyan]")
```

Then add to CLI:

```python
# winflux/cli.py

@cli.command()
def newfeature():
    """Description of new feature."""
    from .modules.new_feature import NewFeatureModule
    module = NewFeatureModule()
    module.do_something()
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear and meaningful commit messages:

### Format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types:

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

### Examples:

```
feat(cleanup): add support for cleaning Windows.old folder

- Added detection for Windows.old folder
- Implemented safe deletion with confirmation
- Added size calculation before deletion

Closes #123
```

```
fix(analyze): correct disk usage calculation for symbolic links

The previous implementation counted symbolic links twice,
leading to incorrect disk usage reports.

Fixes #456
```
