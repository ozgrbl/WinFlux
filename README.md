## üéÆ How to Use (Quick Start Guide)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Check Your System Health

Let's see how your computer is doing:

```bash
python winflux.py report
```

**You'll see:**
- CPU usage (how hard your processor is working)
- RAM usage (how much memory you're using)
- Disk space (how full your hard drive is)
- System uptime (how long your computer has been running)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Find Space Hogs

See what's taking up the most space:

```bash
python winflux.py analyze
```

**You'll get a list** of your biggest files and folders, sorted by size!

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Clean Up Safely (Test Mode)

Before deleting anything, let's do a **dry run** (preview mode):

```bash
python winflux.py clean --dry-run
```

This shows you **what would be deleted** without actually deleting anything. Safe!

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Actually Clean Your System

When you're ready to clean for real:

```bash
python winflux.py clean
```

**The tool will ask for confirmation** before deleting anything. Just type `y` and press Enter.

## ‚ùì Common Questions (FAQ)

### Q: Will this delete my important files?
**A:** No! WinFlux only targets temporary files, cache, and junk. Your documents, photos, and programs are safe.

### Q: Do I need to run as Administrator?
**A:** Some features work better with admin rights, but you can use most features without it. If needed, right-click Command Prompt and select "Run as administrator".

### Q: How much space can I free up?
**A:** It depends on your system, but typically 1-5 GB. Use `--dry-run` to see beforehand!

### Q: Can I undo what WinFlux does?
**A:** Deleted files go to the Recycle Bin when possible. But it's best to use `--dry-run` first to preview.

### Q: Is this safe to use?
**A:** Yes! The code is open-source (you can review it), and it only cleans standard temporary locations that Windows itself cleans.

### Q: My antivirus flagged it!
**A:** Some antivirus software flags system-level tools. This is a false positive. You can check the code yourself - it's all visible!
